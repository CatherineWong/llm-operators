;; Example translations from natural language to a simplified goal name, and then a PDDL goal. Notice that PDDL goals MUST only use predicates, object types, and receptacle types exactly as they appear in the domain above. People may also have been unclear about which stimulus they were talking about, so we list multiple possible guesses for goal if there is uncertainty over what they meant.

;; All goals always correspond to goals that involve picking up some specific item from otype, optionally applying one or more state transformations, and then putting the object in a goal destination in rtypes.

;; Human written natural language goal.
bring a soup spoon from the sofa to a tiny table.

;; PDDL guess 1 for "bring a soup spoon from the sofa to a tiny table."
;; Reasoning: 
1. The goal object is the 'soup spoon'. There is no 'soup spoon' object in the otype list, but there are multiple possible guesses in the otype list. We most likely guess that it means 'LadleType'. 
2. The goal destination is the 'tiny table'. There is no 'tiny table' receptacle in the rtype list. One likely guess is that this actually refers to  'SideTableType'.
3. There are no additional cues suggesting a state transformation.

;; PDDL guess 3 for "put a cooked piece of a cabbage on the table."
1. The goal object is the 'cabbage'. There is no 'cabbage', but this could correspond to the 'LettuceType' in the list.
2. The goal destination is the 'table'. One likely guess is that this actually refers to  'DeskType'.
3. The additional description 'cooked' suggests an isHot state transformation. The additional description 'piece of' suggests an isSliced state transformation.

;; PDDL guess 1 for "take a mug, chill it, and throw it away."
;; Reasoning: There is a 'mug' in the otype list, so this is the most likely guess. 'Chill' most likely corresponds to 'isCool'. 'Throw it away' most likely means the final destination is the 'GarbageCanType' in the rtype list.
